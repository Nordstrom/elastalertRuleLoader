			// events never got them and was instead deleted.

			// The correct way to handle this would be to monitor the symlink instead of the
			// actual file for events. However fsnotify.v1 does not allow us to pass in the
			// IN_DONT_FOLLOW flag to inotify which would allow us to monitor the
			// symlink for changes instead of the de-referenced file. This is not likely to
			// change as fsnotify is designed as cross platform and not all platforms support
